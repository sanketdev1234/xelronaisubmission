# Part 1: Repository Analysis
## Task 1.1: Python Repository Selection

The following analysis identifies which of the provided GitHub repositories are
strictly Python-based, meaning Python is the primary implementation language.

### Python-Primary Repositories

1. **aiokafka**  
   The repository is primarily implemented in Python. The core functionality
   relies on Python’s asyncio framework, and the majority of source files are
   written in Python.

2. **archivematica**  
   Archivematica is mainly developed using Python. Its backend services,
   workflows, and automation components are predominantly implemented in Python.

3. **beets**  
   Beets is a Python-based command-line application and library. Nearly all core
   features and extensions are implemented using Python.

4. **MetaGPT**  
   MetaGPT is primarily written in Python. The main framework, agent logic, and
   orchestration mechanisms are implemented using Python as the dominant language.

### Non Python-Primary Repository

5. **airbyte**  
   Airbyte is not strictly Python-based. It is a multi-language project that uses
   Java, Kotlin, and Python, with Java/Kotlin being the dominant languages rather
   than Python.

### Summary

Strictly Python-based repositories:
- aiokafka
- archivematica
- beets
- MetaGPT

Repository that is not Python-primary:
- airbyte
